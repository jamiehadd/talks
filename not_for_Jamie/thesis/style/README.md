# PC Xaringan Theme

This repo contains files for Phil Chodrow's slide decks produced using Xaringan. These files are lightly modified versions of files copied from [Danielle J. Navarro's](https://djnavarro.net/) repository ["Robust Tools for Psychological Science"](https://github.com/djnavarro/robust-tools).  

To use, download the source into the presentation directory and modify the file `slides.rmd`, modifying css and adding images and other resources as needed.
