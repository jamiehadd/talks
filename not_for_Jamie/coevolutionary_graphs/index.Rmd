# Agenda

1). Quick review of some evolutionary graph theory models (for contrast).

2). **Co**evolutionary models and competing timescales. 

3). Extended example: approximations for the adaptive voter model.

4). *(The hidden agenda): I want you to work on coevolutionary models.*

## Review: **Evolutionary Dynamics on Graphs**

.pull-left[.smaller[1. Choose an individual $i$ proportional to their current fitness $\phi_i$.

# Everything is Borked

1) Whole process is usually Markovian, but neither node- nor edge-upates are in isolation $\rightarrow$ no closed form anything. 

--

2) Edge updates tend to create long-range correlations between node states. $\rightarrow$ mean-field theories will usually perform poorly. 

--

3) What questions should we even be asking of these models?? 

---

class: left, top

# Example: Voter Model (AVM)

Nodes have binary states $\in \{0,1\}$. 
At each time step $t$: 

Pick an edge $e = (u,v)$ where $u$ and $v$ disagree. 

- With probability $\alpha$, .alert[**rewire**]: delete $(u,v)$ and form $(u,w)$, where $w$ agrees with $u$ ("rewire-to-same") or $w$ is uniformly random ("rewire-to-random"). 
- With probability $1-\alpha$, .alert[**vote**]: $v$ adopts $u$'s opinion. 


**Alternative View**: Neutral drift in a population where wild-types prefer to avoid mutants. 

**Alternative Alternative View**: SI model with reactive social distancing.

# Model Timescales

With only rewiring ( $\alpha = 1$ ), disagreement resolved in time $\sim O(n \log n)$ on sparse graphs. .alert[**Fast dynamics, segregated consensus**].  

With only voting ( $\alpha = 0$ ), disagreement resolved in time $\sim O(n^2)$.  .alert[**Slow dynamics, hegemonic consensus**]. 

These two regimes are separated by a .alert[phase transition] in $\alpha$. 
If mean degree is 4, then $\alpha \approx 0.73$ (rewire-to-random).

# Discrete-Time Markovian Approximations

$$\underbrace{\mathbf{m}(t+1) - \mathbf{m}
(t)}_{\text{change in edge counts}} = \underbrace{\alpha\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{x})]}_{\text{rewiring}} +\underbrace{(1-\alpha)\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{V}(\mathcal{G}(t))]}_{\text{voting}}$$

.pull-left[
Second term is non-Markovian $\rightarrow$ no closed form. 

We can approximate it by tracking each discordant edge (under some modeling assumptions). 

Ugly bookkeeping, but easy computation.

# Takeaways

Competing timescales of node and edge dynamics drive rich behavior even in simple systems. 

--

It helps to treat these systems as truly discrete, rather than resort to continuous-time approximations. 

--

This is a .alert[**great area**] for applied mathematicians, with lots of potential in evolutionary dynamics and theoretical ecology. 

--

**The best work here is yet to come!**
